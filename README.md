# PhoenixPointModInjector
Experimental tool to enable multi-mod usage with Snapshot Games' Phoenix Point, utilizing https://github.com/pardeike/Harmony


Effectively forked from https://github.com/BattletechModders/BattleTechModLoader

This is bascially a proof of concept: I'm not very good at this kind of thing and basically people way better at me should take it over for long term development.


# Installation

Place the contents of the .zip file in your (wherever Phoenix POint is installed)\PhoenixPoint\PhoenixPointWin64_Data\Managed folder. Run it.

Run the game to have it generate the Mods folder for the Mod Loader.

Place any mods made for this system inside that folder.
